"""
Script for handling training requests in the air quality prediction system.

This script defines:
- An API endpoint for initiating the model training process.
- Metrics collection for monitoring training request counts, latency, errors, and performance metrics.
- Input and output schemas for validating training configurations and returning training results.

Classes:
    TrainRequest: Schema for incoming training requests.
    TrainResponse: Schema for outgoing training results.

Endpoints:
    POST /train: Accepts a configuration file path and triggers the training pipeline.
